# Examples

There are two examples "working" and "non_working"

These examples can be run using "cargo +nightly run --bin working" or "cargo +nightly run --bin non_working"

Sending in these examples will fail with the IP addresses currently used, these work with the SIMS I'm testing with, change them to an IP for your SIM.
